# TerminaLibs

The way this works is that there is an integer called ``num``, and that dictates what path you take

``num`` is either declared from user input, or it's generated randomly, depending on what the user chooses 

It then does a switch case and for every case it returns a Console.ReadLine with the madlib and string concatenation

It has a duplication check in place, so no back to back dupes

To run, download the release and double click ``MadLibs.exe``
