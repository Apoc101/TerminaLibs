# TerminaLibs

## You need .NET 6.0 to run the EXE
### If you don't want to install .NET 6.0, use the .NET Framework version here: https://github.com/Apoc101/TerminaLibsNET

Basically the way this works is that you have a premade phrase, but nouns, adjective, pronouns, and other words are variables that the users can input. 

It makes for a surprisingly fun  game.

Check ``Program.cs`` in the ``src`` file to see how it actually works.


To run, download the release and double click ``MadLibs.exe``
