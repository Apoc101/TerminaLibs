# TerminaLibs

## You need .NET 6.0 to run the EXE
### If you don't want to install .NET 6.0, use the .NET Framework version here: https://github.com/Apoc101/TerminaLibsCore

Basically the way this works is that you have a premade phrase, but nouns, adjective, pronouns, and other words are variables that the users can input. 

I'm terrible at describing it, so if you want to know just how fun it is I recommend trying it out :)

Check ``Program.cs`` in the ``src`` file for the source code.


To run, download the latest release on the ``Releases`` section on the right, and double click ``MadLibs.exe``
