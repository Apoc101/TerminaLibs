# TerminaLibs

Basically the way this works is that you have a premade phrase, but nouns, adjective, pronouns, and other words are variables that the users can input. 

It makes for a surprisingly fun  game.

It then does a case switch and for every case it returns a Console.ReadLine with the madlib and string concatenation.

To run, download the release and double click ``MadLibs.exe``
